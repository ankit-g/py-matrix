#Welcome to the Matrix

- This is just a humble 100 line python module, not the full-blown cmatrix implementation.
    But hey, who wants to understand all that c code anyway? This module is much easier on the eyes and brain.

- So what's next? Well, this project is just getting started and is actively seeking more contributions.
    So if you have any ideas or improvements, we'd love to hear from you. Let's make this the best Matrix screensaver around!
